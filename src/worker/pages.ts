<p>This connector is run by its owner for their own accounts only.</p>
<h2>Data accessed</h2>
<p>With the owner's approval it accesses the owner's iCloud mail, and for each Google account the owner links, Gmail (read, compose, send, labels, trash) and Google Calendar (calendars and events). It does so only when the owner's AI assistant calls one of its tools.</p>
<h2>Data stored</h2>
<p>It stores the OAuth grants of approved assistants, the owner's mail settings and signatures, and an encrypted refresh token for each linked Google account. Mail and calendar content is not stored; it is passed to the requesting assistant and discarded.</p>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>Data is never sold, shared with third parties, or used for advertising or model training by this connector. The use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
<h2>Removal</h2>
<p>The owner can remove a Google account on the connector's accounts page, which revokes its access, or at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.</p>`
